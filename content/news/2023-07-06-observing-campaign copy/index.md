Planetary Atmospheres Group (PAG) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) is organizing a 2023 Venus atmosphere observation campaign. The PAG-IBS team, led by Dr. LEE Yeon Joo, also invites international telescope teams to collaborate for Venus disk data acquisition from September to October 2023. This campaign will offer a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of the Earth’s twin simultaneously from three different locations in the solar system.
